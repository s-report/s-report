  <h1>The Outrage Is Overblown: The Playoff Needs Tweaks, Not a Rebuild</h1>
  <h4>Dec 09, 2025</h4>
  <p class="body-text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	A lot of fuss has been made about the selection process for the college football playoffs and the incentives that it creates. This has led many people to call for immediate changes to the structure of the college football playoff. The calls for drastic overhauls seem to stem from five main complaints. The first is the dismay that Notre Dame was ranked ahead of Miami for every week’s installment of the rankings except the final one, when Notre Dame was jumped by Miami despite neither team playing. The second is a belief that the playoff discourages teams from scheduling challenging out-of-conference games. The third is anger that two obviously inferior G5 schools made the playoffs over more deserving teams. The fourth is confusion about the importance and consequences of conference championships in the selection process. The final complaint is that four very qualified programs were left out of the playoffs. While these are certainly serious issues, I believe they can and should be remedied with small tweaks rather than a full overhaul of the college football playoff.
  </p>
  <h3>Why the Miami-Notre Dame Flip Actually Made Sense</h3>
  <p class="body-text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	The loudest complaint about the playoff has come from the fact that Miami jumped Notre Dame in the rankings despite neither team playing. Not many people argue that Notre Dame should have been ranked above Miami (both teams were 10–2 and Miami beat Notre Dame early in the season). However, most people believe that teams flipping in the rankings despite neither team playing proves the committee is deeply incompetent. I do agree that Notre Dame should have been ranked behind Miami the entire time—I think head-to-head results should carry significant weight. However, I believe the committee’s process, even if poorly explained, can be justified.
  </p>
  <p class="body-text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Every sports league handles tiebreakers differently. One common theme is that head-to-head results should carry the most weight. If two teams have the same record and they played each other, the winner usually gets the playoff spot. However, leagues treat two-team tiebreakers very differently from multi-team tiebreakers. Take the NFL’s wild-card procedures, for example. If three teams from different divisions (say the Browns, Patriots, and Chargers) are tied with the same record, head-to-head results are ignored unless one team beat both of the others or lost to both of the others. Instead, the NFL uses conference winning percentage. So, if the Browns beat the Patriots, but the Patriots have the highest conference winning percentage, followed by the Chargers and then the Browns, the Chargers would win the tiebreaker despite losing to the Browns. The Browns would finish third.
  </p>
  <p class="body-text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	This is done so that ties are broken by a metric common to all teams. In the previous scenario, there is no way to compare the Chargers to the Browns and Patriots using head-to-head results.
  </p>
  <p class="body-text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	The committee runs into the same issue but at a larger scale. Take the Week Twelve rankings, for example. Thirteen teams with two losses were ranked that week. Honoring head-to-head among thirteen teams while also ranking them using a common metric would have been impossible. That week, they ranked Notre Dame tenth, Miami fifteenth, and Louisville twentieth. However, Louisville beat Miami, and Miami beat Notre Dame. Fully honoring the head-to-head results would have required either ranking Louisville far higher than it deserved or Notre Dame far lower than it deserved. So instead, the committee chose to ignore head-to-head results for multi-team ties and focus solely on metrics common to all teams, such as strength of victory, strength of record, and the “eye test.”
  </p>
  <p class="body-text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	This multi-team approach continued throughout the regular season. Going into conference championship weekend, it was apparently down to three teams for the final playoff spot (more on whether that was correct later): Notre Dame, Miami, and BYU. I personally believe that once the number of teams competing for a spot is small enough, head-to-head should come into play, but I understand the instinct to stick to the same general method for multi-team ties.
  </p>
  <p class="body-text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	In their conference championship game, BYU was dominated so thoroughly that the committee removed them from consideration for the final playoff spot. At that point, it became a two-team tiebreaker, and head-to-head could be applied. That is why Notre Dame was jumped by Miami despite neither team playing and why the flip did not occur until the final rankings update.
  </p>
  <p class="body-text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Admittedly, the committee failed miserably in explaining this process. This is where a change is needed. Rather than sending a representative onto ESPN to explain every controversial ranking live, the committee should release a document outlining the specific reasons for potentially controversial decisions. This would allow the rationale behind certain rankings to be clearly communicated. No major overhaul is needed because of the Miami–Notre Dame flip—only a better explanation of how rankings are determined.
  </p>
  <h3>Tough Non-Conference Scheduling can Still Make Sense</h3>
  <p class="body-text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	The next complaint is that the committee is punishing teams for scheduling challenging non-conference games. The “proof” cited is UT, which finished 9–3 and ranked thirteenth, with signature wins over number seven Texas A&M, number eight Oklahoma, and number fourteen Vanderbilt. Their losses were embarrassing ones to Florida and Georgia and a respectable loss to Ohio State. Critics argue that if Texas had scheduled an easier Week One opponent instead of Ohio State, they would have made the playoffs, proving that teams should avoid difficult non-conference games.
  </p>
  <p class="body-text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	I actually agree with the first part of this assessment. It would have been debatable because of the Florida loss and the nature of the Georgia loss, but I believe Texas’s three top-fifteen wins would have been enough to place them ahead of Oklahoma. So in this case, Texas was hurt by scheduling a difficult non-conference game. However, this does not mean there is no incentive to schedule such games. Consider Miami again. The only reason they made the playoffs is that they scheduled and won a challenging non-conference game. Had they played a weak opponent instead, their résumé would include no signature wins and two mediocre losses. They would not have made the playoff.
  </p>
  <p class="body-text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	You might respond, “But Miami is an ACC team. They can’t rely on the ACC being strong enough to support a flawed résumé. The SEC is different.” I would respond by pointing to Vanderbilt. They finished 10–2 but were ranked fourteenth. Their only two losses were respectable ones to Alabama and Texas. But they played only one Power Four school out of conference—an abysmal Virginia Tech—and no other team on their schedule finished ranked, even with an SEC slate. Even at 10–2, they were an afterthought in the playoff conversation. Ask Vanderbilt whether they wish they had played Ohio State instead of Virginia Tech, and they would say yes one hundred times out of one hundred.
  </p>
  <p class="body-text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Scheduling is always a gamble. You cannot know how strong your conference opponents will be years in advance. A challenging non-conference schedule comes with risk, as Texas showed, but it also comes with reward, as Miami showed. And avoiding such games carries its own risk, as Vanderbilt demonstrated.
  </p>
  <h3>The Auto-Bid Panic is Overblown</h3>
  <p class="body-text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	The next complaint is that Tulane and JMU were so inferior to other deserving candidates that auto-bids for the five highest-ranked conference champions should be eliminated. I think this is a reactionary take. The simpler fix is to ensure that conferences have better processes for determining their championship participants. There is no reason Duke should have been in the ACC championship game. In the era of super-conferences, we need committees or algorithms deciding championship participants—not outdated head-to-head tiebreakers when teams play only a third of their conference. With this fix, we would almost always get quality champions from each Power Four conference. As for the fifth spot, allowing one G5 team seems reasonable. And if they are weak, the fifth seed gets an easier matchup as a reward.
  </p>
  <h3>The Committee’s Biggest Failure: Inconsistent Championship Logic</h3>
  <p class="body-text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	I believe the only truly substantive problem with the current CFB process is the inconsistent treatment of conference championships. There is simply no way to justify what happened with Alabama. To give context: in the Week Fourteen rankings, Notre Dame was ninth and Alabama tenth. Alabama then barely beat a solid Auburn team, while Notre Dame destroyed a terrible Stanford team. The next week, Alabama was ninth and Notre Dame tenth—a reasonable flip, especially considering Notre Dame’s win over Pitt looked worse after Miami also blew Pitt out. But this demonstrates how close Alabama and Notre Dame were. There is no way to justify believing Notre Dame was better going into the week but significantly worse after it.
  </p>
  <p class="body-text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	The next week was conference championship weekend. Notre Dame did not play. Alabama was dominated by Georgia. Given how close the teams were, this should have put Alabama back behind Notre Dame. BYU was blown out by Texas Tech and fell behind Miami (despite Miami not playing). Virginia lost in overtime to Duke and fell two spots. Clearly the committee is willing to punish teams for losing conference championships, and even a mild punishment would have dropped Alabama below Notre Dame.
  </p>
  <p class="body-text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	The committee must make the stakes of conference championship games clear and apply them consistently. If the games should not matter, then they cannot matter for anyone. If they do matter, they must matter for everyone.
  </p>
  <h3>Four Good Teams Missed the Playoffs. That Doesn’t Mean the System is Broken.</h3>
  <p class="body-text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	The final major complaint is that four strong programs—Notre Dame, Texas, Vanderbilt, and BYU—were left out despite excellent playoff cases. The season was so deep that two-loss Utah was not even discussed as being robbed. Critics argue this proves the playoff must be expanded. My response is that this year appears to be an outlier. This season had four two-loss Power Conference teams miss the playoffs. Last year had two (and no one seriously argued for two-loss BYU). In 2023, no two-loss Power Conference team finished outside the top twelve. The same was true in 2022; in fact, that year two three-loss teams finished in the top nine. There is no perfect playoff size that will always capture every deserving team. Some good teams will be left out; some undeserving teams will slip in. Before expanding the playoff, we should wait to see if this level of depth is actually a consistent issue.
  </p>
  <h3>What Actually Needs Changing</h3>
  <p class="body-text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	In all, the only substantive changes needed for the college football playoff concern how conferences select their championship participants and how the committee evaluates those games. Some minor procedural changes—such as releasing written explanations for controversial rankings—would also help. Ideally, there would be no weekly rankings releases, but ESPN would never allow that. So if weekly releases continue, they must be accompanied by a clear explanation of the process.
  </p>
  <p class="body-text"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	The committee is not incompetent, and the playoff system is not broken or in need of a serious overhaul. Some good teams missed out this year, but that is simply how sports work.
